jetbrain IDE/androidStudio.
This is for someone who likes to use gitBash, but not IDE's git tools.

    How to use it?

Right click on project name, as your project menu opened, the "git bash here" shows on the bottom.
It'll go and open your project directory into git bash.

And your git-bash.exe has to be in on of list:
    "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-bash.exe",
    "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\git-bash.exe",
    "D:\\Program Files\\Git\\git-bash.exe",
    "D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\git-bash.exe".
    
Enjoy it!
